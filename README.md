## Executive Summary
The purpose of Unit one is for us students to figure out how the IT1025 course is designed and set up for us. In the beginning we were introduced to Gifthub and signing up for an account. We learned how to make a Template and make a branch. After following all the steps that were provided we moved onto learning what screen capture is which in other words is just taking a screen shot of your Windows,Mac or Chromebook help screen and upload it onto Gifthub.

## Conclusion
In Unit 1 Lab 1 I learned a lot about what's required for IT1025. I did have a difficult time time trying to process what gift hub was exactly when I first started. I've gotten help from students with trying to comprehend what i'm exactly doing step by step. After getting help from a student named Brad i've gptten a bit better understanding of everything in Gifthub. I'm looking forward to learning more things that i can do on Gifthub.
